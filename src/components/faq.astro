		title: "What is this?",
		description: "TenguCTI is a decentralized platform for sharing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), leveraging blockchain technology to ensure data integrity, traceability, and trust. Designed for security analysts, researchers, and organizations, it enables the publication, querying, and validation of indicators of compromise (IoCs), adversary tactics, and other threat data without relying on a central authority. Blockchain serves as a verification layer, making shared intelligence tamper-proof once recorded. TenguCTI also integrates decentralized payment and subscription mechanisms, allowing users to offer CTI under various access models-free, reputation-based, or token-gated. This fosters an active, self-sustaining community and promotes collaborative, reliable intelligence exchange.",

	{
		title: "How does TenguCTI work?",
		description: "TenguCTI operates on a decentralized network where users can publish, query, and validate Cyber Threat Intelligence data. It uses blockchain technology to ensure that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, providing a tamper-proof record of all shared intelligence. Users can access this data through various subscription models, including free access, reputation-based access, or token-gated access."
